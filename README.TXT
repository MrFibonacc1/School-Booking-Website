This project was made during my time as a freelancer. The high school i attended requested me to make this booking website for the school to manage the bookings and make the shift from written bookings to online bookings

I have organized the files into different sections of the software:

Admin Panel : Contains all of the files needed in the admin side and makes up the majority of the code

Calender Folder : This folder containts all the files to make the calender on the website. This is where all the bookings can be displayed. 

The rest of the files on the main page make up the public side of the website.

This project is accessible publicly if you visit the url: www.myEduBooking.com
However, it may be possible that the url link has expired and you are unable to reach that web page.

To set up this project it would be require ZAAMP. ZAAMP contains a page where you can launch a local server on your machine
